## Overview

ðŸ§© This application is a core component of the **AI Search** feature in Supervisely and works in conjunction with the **Embeddings Generator** and **CLIP as Service** applications.

**Projections Service** is a high-performance headless microservice that provides advanced dimensionality reduction, clustering, and diverse sampling capabilities for high-dimensional vector embeddings. The service enables efficient visualization and analysis of complex embedding spaces through state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

The service operates as a background microservice and integrates seamlessly with the Supervisely ecosystem, providing RESTful API endpoints for creating 2D/3D projections, identifying clusters in embedding space, and selecting diverse representative samples from large datasets.

> **Note**: This application is designed to be used in conjunction with the **Embeddings Generator** application, so you don't need to run it separately. It will be automatically started when you access the **AI Search** feature in Supervisely.

### Key Capabilities

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Transform high-dimensional embeddings into 2D/3D space for visualization and analysis
- **Clustering Analysis**: Identify natural groupings and patterns in embedding spaces
- **Diverse Sampling**: Select representative subsets from large datasets using intelligent sampling strategies
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Support for PCA, UMAP, t-SNE, DBSCAN, K-means, and hybrid approaches
